# QinHang-RAG-GeoQA
RAG-based Geological QA System for the Qin-Hang Metallogenic Belt using ChatGLM3-6B and LangChain

# üîß Source Code Overview

This directory includes the four main scripts that reproduce the RAG-based geological QA system as described in the paper:
**"Enhancing Geological Knowledge Engineering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Case Study of the Qin‚ÄìHang Metallogenic Belt"**

## üßæ 1_pdf_to_txt.py
- Parses geological PDF documents and extracts plain text.
- Supports both OCR-based and standard text-based PDFs.
- Output: `.txt` files used for embedding.

## üßæ 2_txt_to_vector.py
- Converts `.txt` files into vector embeddings using the `bge-large-zh-v1.5` model.
- Embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast retrieval.
- Configurable parameters: embedding model, chunk size, dimension, index type.

## üßæ 3_faiss_retrieval.py
- Loads the FAISS vector database and retrieves top-K relevant documents based on user queries.
- Outputs the retrieved context to be passed to the LLM.

## üßæ 4_rag_glm_answer.py
- Performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by feeding question + retrieved context to `ChatGLM3-6B`.
- Generates domain-specific answers with source-backed references.
- Optionally includes support for model fine-tuning or API deployment.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Instructions

```bash
# 1. Convert PDF corpus to text
python 1_pdf_to_txt.py

# 2. Embed text and build FAISS index
python 2_txt_to_vector.py

# 3. Retrieve context for a sample query
python 3_faiss_retrieval.py --query "What are the mineralization characteristics of the Qin-Hang Belt?"

# 4. Generate response via ChatGLM3-6B
python 4_rag_glm_answer.py

## üîÑ Reproducibility for Review

To address reviewer concerns regarding evaluation reproducibility and methodological clarity, we provide four core scripts replicating the RAG QA workflow as described in Section 3 of the manuscript.

Each script maps directly to a step in the pipeline: document parsing, semantic embedding, vector-based retrieval, and RAG-based answer generation.

Scripts are fully documented and can be run independently or as a pipeline.


# üìä Evaluation Design and Results

This folder contains the full quantitative evaluation of our RAG-based geological QA system, as described in Section 4 of the paper.

We present 100 domain-specific questions covering regional geology, mineralization processes, tectonic features, and ore types in the Qin-Hang Metallogenic Belt. Five different models were tested on the same question set:

- ChatGLM3-6B (base)
- ChatGLM3-6B + RAG (ours)
- GPT-4o
- Bing Chat (2024)
- Gemini (Google)
